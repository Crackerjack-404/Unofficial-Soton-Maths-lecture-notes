### These notes are **not official** and are based on my understanding of lectures, problem sheets, and independent reading.  


These notes are not intended to be complete, polished, or by any means a verbatim record of lectures. They exist largely because I was dissatisfied with solutions that worked without an intuitive explanation, and with substutitions and theorems that seemed to appear out of nowhere, and with textbooks that present mathematics as a finished product rather than a process of discovery. 

Much of what is written here comes from moments where something "worked", but I didn't understand why it had to work, or why it was the right approach to try in the first place. My notes try and address the gap between the formal mathematics taught and the thinking that leads up to it. 

Where appropriate, I include questions I initially found confusing, common pitfalls, and informal explanations alongside formal definitions and proofs. These notes reflect how ideas made sense to me, so if something here feels over-explained, that's usually become it once confused me.

The notes may contain errors or simplifications. Always cross-check with official lecture notes, textbooks, or lecturers’ guidance before relying on them.

This repo contains my working notes for first-year mathematics modules at the Southampton currently include topics for the 2nd Semester: 
- Calculus II
- Linear Algebra II
- Dynamics and Relativity
- Computational Mathematics

1st Semester notes were made in Obsidian and deployed on Vercel instead of GitHub pages, which can be found here:
