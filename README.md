### These notes are **not official** and are based on my understanding of lectures, problem sheets, and independent reading.  

The aim is to build a clear, student-friendly guide that complements the official course materials, rather than replaces them.

These notes may contain errors or simplifications.  
Always cross-check with official lecture notes, textbooks, or lecturers’ guidance before relying on them.

This repo contains my working notes for first-year mathematics modules at the Southampton currently include topics for the 2nd Semester: 
- Calculus II
- Linear Algebra II
- Dynamics and Relativity
- Computational Mathematics

1st Semester notes were made in Obsidian and deployed on Vercel instead of GitHub pages, which can be found here:
